# Road-Image-Captioning-using-CNN-LSTM

This project aims to generate descriptive captions for road images using a CNN-LSTM architecture. By combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for sequence generation, the model can produce meaningful captions for a variety of road scenes.


## Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a system that can automatically generate captions for images of roads and describe if they are suitable for travel. This involves training a neural network model on a dataset of road images and their corresponding captions. 

## Dataset
A custom dataset was created consisting of 2000 images of roads that appear dangerous, and similary a csv file consisiting of 2000 captions for each image was created.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Road-Image-Captioning.git
cd Road-Image-Captioning
pip install -r requirements.txt
